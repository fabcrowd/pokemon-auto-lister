"""The one gate: does the candidate bundle beat the live bundle on the fixed regression set, hold on the exam,
and add no wrong "high" reads? Replays search + fusion like exam.score_exam, but with the adapter in the loop.

candidate / live: dicts of optional parts {"memory": pack bytes or Pack, "adapter": adapter.bin bytes, "check": ignored
here: it drops false boxes and does not change what a card is answered}. exam / regression: (embeddings, card ids)
like regression.load_regression. The adapter maps the query and every catalog row; memory rows are compared with the
raw query and must beat the RAW catalog top score (lib/references.js applyMemory does the same). An answer that the adapter or memory changed is advisory, never "high" (self-learning plan, "One gate").
